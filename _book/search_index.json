In the Exercise 5 folder, you will find partially completed R scripts. To answer the questions, try to complete the missing parts (they are highlighted by a #TO COMPLETE# comment). We also provided complete R scripts, but try to work it out on your own first! Some anecdotic reports suggest that expression of PAG may vary as function of number of days of pregnancy. We could, therefore, hypothesized that PAG’s Se and Sp may vary if the test is conducted early (≤ 35 days post-AI) compared to later (&gt;35 days post-AI). When cross-tabulating the studies results for the PAG and US tests as function of days since AI, we get: Table. Cross-classified results from a PAG and US test as function of number of days since breding. ≤ 35 days &gt;35 days US+ US- US+ US- PAG+ 143 11 PAG+ 112 10 PAG- 2 136 PAG- 0 82 1.Start from the partially completed Question 1.R script located in Exercise 5 folder. Build a model for two diagnostic tests, one single population, but with Se and Sp of the PAG test varying as function of days since breeding. Use the Romano et al. (2006) results, to inform the priors for the Se and Sp of a US exam (Se: 0.90, 95CI: 0.85, 0.95; Sp: 0.95, 95CI: 0.90, 0.97). Assume conditional independence between tests. How many degrees of freedom do you have and how many unknown parameters do you need to estimate? Based on your results, would you conclude that PAG accuracy is influenced by number of days since breeding? 12.2 Answers 1. How many degrees of freedom do you have and how many unknown parameters do you need to estimate? Based on your results, would you conclude that PAG accuracy is influenced by number of days since breeding? Answer: We would have 6 degrees of freedom and there are 8 unknown parameters to estimate (one Se and one Sp for US, 2 Se and 2 Sp for PAG, and two prevalence). We need two informative priors to make the LCM identifiable. The results from this LCM are below. Table. Results for the LCM alloing for varying accuracy of PAG as function of days since breeding. Parameter Median 95CI Prevalence 28-35 days 0.521 0.462, 0.580 Prevalence 36-45 days 0.584 0.512, 0.653 Se US 0.928 0.895, 0.956 Sp US 0.977 0.957, 0.990 Se PAG 28-35 days 0.991 0.963, 1.00 Se PAG 36-45 days 0.994 0.966, 1.00 Sp PAG 28-35 days 0.980 0.927, 0.999 Sp PAG 36-45 days 0.962 0.879, 0.998 There was little difference between the 28-35 days since breeding vs. 36-45 days since breeding accuracy parameters. Below, I have plotted the two PAG Se and Sp posterior distributions to illustrate how similar they are. However, since we are not in a Frequentist framework, “testing” whether the 28-35 days vs. 36-45 days accuracy parameters are statistically different is not an option here.
